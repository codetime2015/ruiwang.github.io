## About (CV)
Currently, I am working as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow with Department of Computer Science and Technology of Shandong University and State Grid Shandong Electric Power Research Institute, China.

I received the B.E. degree in the Department of Software Engineering, Shandong University, China, in 2013, and received the Ph.D. degree in the Department of Computer Science and Technology, Shandong University, China, in 2018.  My main research interests include Software-defined Networking, Software-defiend Wireless Senor Networks, DDoS, Security, Trust.
